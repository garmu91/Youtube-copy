This project is a concept proof to demonstrate my ability to accurately replicate complex, high-traffic user interfaces.
The YouTube platform presents a unique challenge in organizing its content (videos, comments, sidebar) that requires a robust design strategy.
I used pure HTML5 and CSS3 to build a structure that mimics the browsing experience of the original platform without resorting to JavaScript libraries.
Work In Progress!
